## Structure ##

The filemanager is build out of a widget called filedisplay. It is written as Elementary widget and integrates well with the other elm widgets. Looking into futur we could use this widget in a fileselector or other places where file needs to be crawled.

There are also three little librarys, elementary_ext efm_lib and emous.

### Elementary_Ext ###

Widgets which are build as seperated library.

### efm_lib ###

A abstraction for filesystem monitoring and listing.

Once a file appeared all big things are done async, things like fetching statÂ´s, mimetypes and such things.

### Emous ###

It should abstract the problems of listing and monitoring changes in mountpoints and with mountdevices.

In general nothing else than a simple signal system with a little module loader.

## General ##

The Filemanager itsself does not have that many operations or features or helpers.
